A Raspberry Pi‚Äìbased Bluetooth HID remote that integrates with Home Assistant via MQTT.  
It bridges a USB IR/RF receiver (evdev) ‚Üí BLE HID (keyboard + consumer control) and HA automations.

## üîß Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amsound/pihub-remote.git
cd pihub-remote
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

The installer will:

- Create a Python virtualenv and install deps (`requirements.txt`)
- Configure **bluetoothd** with `--experimental`
- Apply a **BlueZ** config block (LE + fast connect, etc.)
- Create and enable a **systemd** service: `pihub.service`
- (Optional) Set your **hostname** interactively

> Reboot after install if you changed hostname or BlueZ config.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Edit just one file per room:

`pihub/config/room.yaml`:
```yaml
room: "living_room"
device_name: "PiHub-LivingRoom"   # Bluetooth advertised name (and suggested hostname)
mqtt:
  host: "192.168.70.24"
  port: 1883
  prefix_bridge: "pihub/living_room"
  username: "remote"
  password: "remote"

entities:
  input_select_activity: "input_select.living_room_activity"
  speakers: "media_player.living_room_speakers_unified"
  radio_script: "script.living_room_universal_radio_tune"
  mute_script: "script.living_room_toggle_mute"
```

`activities.yaml`, `keymap.yaml` and `macros/` are **static** and don‚Äôt need per-room edits.  
Entity names inside activities are substituted from `room.yaml`.

## üì° MQTT Topics

- **Health (retained):** `pihub/<room>/health` ‚Üí `online` / `offline`  
- **Status JSON:** `pihub/<room>/status/json` ‚Üí CPU/Mem/Disk/IP/Uptime/Temp/Undervoltage/BT devices  
- **Activity state (HA ‚Üí PiHub):**  
  `pihub/<room>/input_select/<input_select_activity>/state`  
- **Service calls (PiHub ‚Üí HA):**  
  `pihub/<room>/ha/service/call` (payload: `{"domain":"...","service":"...","data":{...}}`)  
- **Commands/macros (HA ‚Üí PiHub):**  
  `pihub/<room>/cmd/<namespace>/...` (e.g. `.../cmd/atv/on`)
